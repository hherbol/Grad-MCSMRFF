Parameterizing for MCSMRFF
===================================

1.	Build example structures for your system in Avogadro (including any OPLS bonds)

2.	Optimize with orca (e.g. Opt B97-D3 def2-TZVP)

3.	Analyze at higher level (e.g. SP RI-B2PLYP D3BJ def2-TZVP)

4.	Great a training set directory that houses directories for each orca result.  Each directory must include the .out, .engrad and system.cml file for that system

5.	Run `python gradient_tersoff.py RUN_NAME`. The output parameters will start to appear in lammps/RUN_NAME_best.tersoff.
