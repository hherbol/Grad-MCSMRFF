Created new pair style lj/cut/coul/inout based on lj/cut/coul/dsf
Replacing cut_lj and cut_coul with cut_inner and cut_outer, cut_ljsq with cut_inner_sq
In initial command, changed required narg to be exactly 3, not 2-optional-3
In individual pair coeffs, optional last argument = inner cutoff for that pair
rsq = pow( pow(rsq,N/2) + pow(cut_inner[itype][jtype],N), 2/N); //modified to include inner cutoff

Making fix parameterize out of fix nve
FixNVE => FixParameterize

Fixes can't easily get energy: try using a min_style instead
Created min_params.cpp and min_params.h
Added "virtual" to "virtual void modify_params(int, char **);" in min.h

coul/cut and coul/dsf slightly different but not terribly. alpha=0.2-0.25 recommended by Fennel. 
min_style params matches coul/dsf accurately if given same parameters via LAMMPS, but vector input does not match, either for charges or LJ/sigma. Vectors themselves seem to be fine - must be unpack_params.
