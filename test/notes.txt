Created new pair style lj/cut/coul/inout based on lj/cut/coul/dsf
Replacing cut_lj and cut_coul with cut_inner and cut_outer, cut_ljsq with cut_inner_sq
In initial command, changed required narg to be exactly 3, not 2-optional-3
In individual pair coeffs, optional last argument = inner cutoff for that pair
rsq = pow( pow(rsq,N/2) + pow(cut_inner[itype][jtype],N), 2/N); //modified to include inner cutoff

Making fix parameterize out of fix nve
FixNVE => FixParameterize

Fixes can't easily get energy: try using a min_style instead
Created min_params.cpp and min_params.h
Added "virtual" to "virtual void modify_params(int, char **);" in min.h
Added "virtual" to "virtual void ev_set(bigint);" in min.h
